# Purchase any item on Amazon using EVM
## ðŸš€ Quickstart

This example demonstrates how to use GOAT to **purchase any item on Amazon US** using EVM and Crossmint's headless checkout API. This example uses [Base](https://base.org) but you can implement it with any other EVM network by changing the chain and RPC URL.

You can use this example with any other agent framework, chain, and wallet of your choice.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat.git && cd goat
```

2. Run the following commands from the `typescript` directory:
```bash
cd typescript
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

3. Go to the example directory:
```bash
cd examples/by-use-case/evm-purchase-on-amazon
```

4. Copy the `.env.template` and populate with your values:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `RPC_PROVIDER_URL`
- `CROSSMINT_API_KEY`

## Usage
1. Run the interactive CLI:
```bash
pnpm ts-node index.ts
```

2. Chat with the agent:
- Purchase <amazon-link>

## Using in production
In production, developers require advanced wallet setups that utilize [smart wallets](https://docs.goat-sdk.com/concepts/smart-wallets), which allow them to:
1. **Increase security** by setting programmable permissions (e.g. limiting fund amounts, restricting contract interactions, and defining required signatures)
2. **Maintain regulatory compliance** by ensuring agent wallets are non-custodial. This means that:
     - Launchpads, wallet providers, or agent platforms never have access to agents' wallets.
     - Agent platforms do not require money transmitter licenses.

### Agent Wallets
[Crossmint](https://docs.crossmint.com/wallets/quickstarts/agent-wallets) offers one of the most advanced solutions for agent developers and launchpads: [Agent Wallets](https://docs.crossmint.com/wallets/quickstarts/agent-wallets).

To integrate Agent Wallets with GOAT, check out the following quickstarts:
1. Agent Wallets Quickstart [[EVM](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/examples/by-wallet/crossmint-smart-wallets), [Solana](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/examples/by-wallet/crossmint-smart-wallets)]
2. [Agent Launchpad Starter Kit](https://github.com/Crossmint/agent-launchpad-starter-kit/)

## Demo Results

| Step | User Input | Agent Response | Transaction Result |
|------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | "I want to buy https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SPZ2HGT on amazon" | Requests required information (name, address, email, payment method, chain) | N/A |
| 2 | Provides details: email: arshroop@paella.dev, address: 1211 Walsh avenue, Coral Gables, FL 33146, payment: USDC on Base Sepolia | Processes purchase with Crossmint API | Order created successfully |
| 3 | N/A | Confirms purchase completion | Transaction ID: 0xc1872b40d5c1ad8064f3fc372906779258889a8405baa4132e4a488bda4e08236 |
